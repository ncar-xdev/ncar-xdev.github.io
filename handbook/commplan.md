# Communications

:::{warning} **TODO:**
This document should detail how to use each of the different communication channels
that we have available to us, what to do when we receive communication over that
channel, and when to use each channel ourselves.  In general, this is a table with
rows for each communication channel and columns for what to do when we receive a
message over that channel and when *we* should use that communication channel ourselves
:::

| Communication Channel | What to do if we receive something over this channel? | When should we use this channel? |
