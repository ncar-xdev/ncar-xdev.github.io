# The Xdev Handbook

:::{admonition} NEW!!!
:class: warning
This content is new and should be reviewed by the team!
:::

The Xdev Handbook exists to serve as a documentation of *how we work* and *what is expected from us.*  This is not meant to be a top-down declaration, but rather a document that is crafted and tailored *by the Team* to develop and share our best practices.  This book is where team members can go to know how to work with each other, and it is where *external collaborators* should go to learn how to work with the Xdev Team.

Whether you are a core Xdev developer or a university scientist collaborating with the Xdev Team, this handbook is your guide to everything Xdev!  This book details *how we work*, *where we work*, *how we conduct ourselves when we work*, *how we stay in touch with each other*, and *what is expected from each of us.*

On the next page, we'll talk about *what is expected from each of us.*

:::{admonition} You own this book!
:class: important
If something we are doing seems like it's not working for you, then feel free to submit a pull request to change this document!  This document needs to stay *up-to-date* and *complete* to be useful, and it's our responsibility as a Team to make sure that is so.
