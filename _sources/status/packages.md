# Package Metrics

Below are some of the metrics related to activity on repositories that Xdev owns
and package downloads for repositories that are published packaged on PyPI or
Conda Forge.  These metrics are updated periodically, so check back later for
new information.  (*Note that Conda download statistics can be months out of
date, so it is likely that download numbers for the current and last months will
be inaccurate.*)
