# Tutorials

:::{warning} **TODO:**
This document should be an autogenerated (if possible) list of past and future tutorials, with links to the videos etc.

We are currently still organizing and conducting the Python Tutorial Seminar
Series.  These tutorials will continue throughout the next year.
All of these tutorials are recorded and the videos hosted for free
viewing on YouTube as part of the
[ProjectPythia channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZPBqJal5uKpO8ZiwzavCw).

Our upcoming tutorials can be viewed on the
[ESDS Python Training page](https://ncar.github.io/esds/calendar/#python-training).
